# html-slides
Say good-bye to ppt. Write your slides in HTML. You are a programmer, after
all.

There is really only one trick here, which is using `page-break-after: always`
style.  When you print these slides (e.g., to PDF), there is a page-break after
each page.

You will probably want to print these as landscape.
